ans. comment out C:\Users\DHRUV\AppData\Local\Programs\python3\python3310\lib\site-packages\praw\models\reddit\base.py   line 36 37 38


30.04.2022 :there is maybe an update in PRAW : when executing term "None" appears in txtxt.txt file so to overcome
                temp_final is made which delete the term None and all the things appears normal 

            
            find about v.reddit stuff links


            still gyfcat are coming in redgif.txt and the gyfcat_texst,json are working fine

        --> IMPORTANT ***   : in the sub_list.csv file donot have another empty line it would not work for transfer data
                            ERROR: path(D:/...................username/n)
